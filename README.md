# LeetCode Daily Problems Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode Daily Problems repository! In this repository, you'll find a collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems. My goal is to solve at least one LeetCode problem every day and document my progress here.

## Motivation

The purpose of this repository is to track my daily progress in solving LeetCode problems. By committing to solving a problem every day, I aim to improve my problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding proficiency. This journey is also a way for me to share my learning process with the community and connect with fellow programmers and enthusiasts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem difficulty and then by problem number. Each problem is contained within its own directory, named according to the problem's title. Inside each problem directory, you'll typically find:

- The problem statement or a brief description.
- My solution(s) to the problem in various programming languages.
- Any accompanying notes or explanations related to the problem or solution.

### Easy Problems

- **Problem 1**
  - [Problem Statement](Easy/Problem_1/README.md)
  - [Solution (Python)](Easy/Problem_1/python solution.py)
  - [Notes](Easy/Problem_1/notes.md)
- ...

### Medium Problems

- **Problem 42**
  - [Problem Statement](Medium/Problem_42/problem.md)
  - [Solution (Java)](Medium/Problem_42/solution.java)
  - [Notes](Medium/Problem_42/notes.md)
- ...

### Hard Problems

- **Problem 137**
  - [Problem Statement](Hard/Problem_137/problem.md)
  - [Solution (C++)](Hard/Problem_137/solution.cpp)
  - [Notes](Hard/Problem_137/notes.md)
- ...

## How to Contribute

While this is primarily a personal repository for tracking my progress, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and improvements from the community. If you have a better solution to a problem, found a mistake in my code, or want to suggest a different approach, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
